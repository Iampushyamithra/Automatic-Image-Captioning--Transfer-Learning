I. The Machine Learning model uses:
  
  --> Python version 3.6

NOTE: Python version 3.6 is *consiously and specifically chosen* to implement the Machine Learning model *to integrate and incorporate all the packages used AT ONCE.* 
      *Changing the version of the Python code is rendering a few set of packages inoperable*

II. Libraries being used in this ML model are:

Be sure to your package manager have the following libraries installed:

  (1) Tensorflow 
  
  (2) Numpy - Numerical Python
  
  (3) Matplotlib
  
  (4) Keras
  
  (5) Pandas
  
  (6) OS
  
  (7) String
  
  (8) Time
  
  (9) Pickle
  
  (10) PIL
  
  (11) Glob
  
  
  NOTE: *Please DONOT change the order/ sequence of the libraries. The order in which the packages are loaded are never at all to be disturbed/ changed.*
  
  
III. Deployment Phase:

  --> The deployment of the model has been achieved using FLASK. The front end is a HTML that acts as an interface for inputting the Images, 
      and the final caption generated would be displayed on the HTML page.
